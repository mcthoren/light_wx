This is a project for using a raspberry pi to measure light conditions on our balcony.


Reasons and firsts for this project:
* Learning more python3, and migrating my python2 stuff to python3 stuff.
* Learining circuit python.
* First use of a BSD/ISC sorta lic. I usually use public domain, but the legality of pd is apparently just not that clear across many jurisdictions, whereas bsd/isc has been better tested.
* And finally the point of all this is to actually measure something, namely light. To do this i'm using:
  * An adafruit Veml 6070 breakout board.
    * datasheet
    * tutorial link
  * An Adafruit TSL 2561 breakout board.
    * datasheet
    * tutorial link

* thank you adafruit
